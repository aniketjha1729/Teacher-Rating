<h1>About RateYourGuru.in</h1> 
<hr>
<p style="font-size: 28px;">In India, there are lots of colleges, each contains hundreds of gurus (teachers/professors), and thousands of students. It's a real difficult task to maintain the quality of education being given in these colleges. According to a survey, many students said that they don't attend classes because they are not able to understand the contents taught by faculty members of college. The culprit is the opaque system, in which students fall unknowingly i.e. they have no idea about the faculty of the college they are going to be part of.</p>
<h2>THE IDEA</h2>  
 <p style="font-size: 28px;"> Wouldn't it be great if there be a faculty rating website by which you can rate your teachers according to how they teach? It will not only help the teachers to upgrade their teaching skills but it will also be useful for the students to opt the best guru.  
 Rateyourguru.in is India's first teacher rating portal where you can evaluate your teacher on the basis of their teaching capability. Your rating and reviews can be a breakthrough in the current education system, as it will help the students to select the best teachers and it will help the teachers to get applause for their work or a signal to upgrade their teaching skills. It covers all the engineering colleges of India with its faculty and you have the right to rate them.
